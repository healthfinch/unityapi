# Unityapi

The Unityapi Gem is a ruby wrapper for the Allscripts Unity API.  See http://asdn.unitysandbox.com/UnitySDK/SDK/ for more information regarding the Allscripts API
 
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'unityapi'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install unityapi

## Usage

1.) Initialize the Unity Client

    client = Unityapi::UnityClient.new(unity_username, unity_password, appname, unity_server_url)
	
2.) Make calls with the client

    unity_response = client.magic_action(action_name, provider_username, patient_id, param_1, param_2, param_3, param_4, param_5, param_6)
	patient_data = client.get_patient("jmedici", 77) #shortcut for the GetPatient Unity Call - gets patient 77 for provider with username "jmedici"

3.) Close the connection

	client.close
   
The UnityApi Gem uses Savon as the SOAP client to broker the connection, and does all the setup work for managing the security token for you as you use Unity Calls.

For a full list of supported calls please browse the source found in lib/unityapi/unity_client.rb or use the client.magic_action
